## Current Progress
* Currently being refactored to work in Rust (because (a) speed, (b) proper thread safety, (c) better tooling, etc.) and have proper directory structure/setup scripts because, as of now, it's a single file. The project submission is slightly old, and I hadn't realized the issues with deploying Python in an embedded context by then.
